# Linear Graphing Calculator  

## Overview  
This project is a graphing calculator built in JavaScript using Code.org’s canvas library. It plots linear equations from slope–intercept form as well as individual coordinate points, providing a visual representation of algebraic concepts.  

## Features  
- Plots linear equations from slope–intercept form (`y = ax + b`)  
- Supports plotting of individual coordinate points  
- Automatic calculation and display of x- and y-intercepts  
- Adjustable zoomable window for exploring graphs at different scales  
- Responsive legend that dynamically scales grid lines relative to the current view  

## How to Use  
1. Enter values for slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`) to draw a line.  
2. Plot additional coordinate points by entering x and y values.  
3. Use the window controls to zoom in or out (window values must be multiples of 5).  
4. View intercepts and grid scaling in the automatically updated legend.
